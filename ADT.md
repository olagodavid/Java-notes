<h1>ABSTRACT DATA TYPES</h1>

<h4>What is an ADT</h4>

*A type in which
	*What the operations of the type are is public
		*That is, public to the client

	*How the type is implemented is private
		*That is, private to the client

*Abstract = irrelevant details are ignored
*The ADT is abstract because how the ADT is implemented is ignored


<h4>ADTs and Program Design</h4>

*ADTs are an important part of bottom up program desgin
*In practice, programs are built using a combination of top down and bottom up approaches:

	*Top down:
		*Decompose problem into subproblems, then decompose subproblems. Repeat until subproblems are simple
		*Structure charts are a common design tool

*Bottom up
	*Design a set of tools and use them to build a solution the problem
	 *The tools are the values and operations of ADTs

*Designing ADTs is an essential part of bottom up design
